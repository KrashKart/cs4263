"""Run your solution on this project's practice cases.

Each run loads a case from input/, calls your
solve(data), and prints what came back next to the saved expected output.

Usage, from this folder:

    python run_local.py                  # every case in input/
    python run_local.py case_01.json     # only the named case(s)
